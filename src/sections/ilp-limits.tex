\section{ILP limits}\label{sec:ilp-limits}
\subsection{Superscalar}\label{subsec:superscalar}
Superscalar execution allows multiples-issue and out-of-order execution.

\paragraph{Key requirements}
\begin{description}
    \item[-] Fetching more instructions per clock cycle: no major problem provided the instruction cache can sustain
    the bandwidth and can manage more requests at the same time.
    \item[-] Decide on data and control dependencies: dynamic scheduling and dynamic branch prediction
\end{description}

\paragraph{Beyond CPI = 1} 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item issue multiple instruction per clock-cycle
    \item varying number of instruction per cycle (1 to 8)
    \item scheduled by the compiler or HW
\end{itemize}
\[CPI_{ideal} =\frac{1}{issue-width}\]


With single-issue ILP we can be reach an ideal CPI = 1.
With superscalar execution our \textit{ideal} CPI can decrease furthermore.

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{subsec:assumptions}
The ideal machine must have:
\begin{description}
    \item[Register renaming] infinite virtual registers and all WAW and WAR hazards are avoided
    \item[Branch prediction] perfect, no mispredictions
    \item[Jump prediction] all jumps perfectly predicted, machine with perfect speculation and an unbounded buffer of
    instructions available
    \item[Memory address alias analysis]\footnote{Alias analysis is a technique used to determine if a storage location may be accessed in more than one way} addresses are know and a store can be moved before a load provided the 
    addresses not equal 
    \item[One cycle latency for all instructions] unlimited number of instructions issued per clock cycle
\end{description}

\subsection{Limits on window size}\label{subsec:limits-on-window-size}
Dynamic analysis is necessary to approach
perfect branch prediction (impossible at compile
time!).
A perfect dynamic-scheduled CPU should:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item[-] Look arbitrarily far ahead to find set of instructions to
    issue, predict all branches perfectly
    \item[-] Rename all registers uses (no WAW, WAR hazards);
    \item[-] Determine whether there are data dependencies
    among instructions in the issue packet, rename if
    necessary
    \item[-] Determine if memory dependencies exist among
    issuing instructions, handle them
    \item[-] Provide enough replicated functional units to allow all
    ready instructions to issue.
\end{itemize}
Size affects the number of comparisons necessary to determine
RAW dependencies.
The number of comparisons to evaluate for data dependencies among n register-to-register
instructions in the issue phase is \(n^2 - n\).
