\subsubsection{Superscalar}
Superscalar execution allows multiples-issue and out-of-order execution.

\paragraph{Key requirements}
\begin{description}
    \item[-] Fetching more instructions per clock cycle
\end{description}

\section{ILP limits}\label{sec:ilp-limits}
With single-issue ILP we can be reach an ideal CPI = 1.
With superscalar execution our \textit{ideal} CPI can decrease furthermore.

\paragraph{Assumptions} The ideal machine must have:
\begin{description}
    \item[Register renaming] infinite virtual registers and all WAW and WAR hazards are avoided
    \item[Branch prediction] perfect, no mispredictions
    \item[Jump prediction] all jumps perfectly predicted, machine with perfect speculation and an unbounded buffer of
    instructions available
    \item[Memory address alias analysis]\footnote{Alias analysis is a technique used to determine if a storage location may be accessed in more than one way} addresses are know and a store can be moved before a load provided the 
    addresses not equal 
    \item[One cycle latency for all instructions] unlimited number of instructions issued per clock cycle
\end{description}
